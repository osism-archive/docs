# Issue labels

## Labels management

The labels are managed via the [github-manager](https://github.com/osism/github-manager).

The config.yaml file lists all available labels. There they can be added accordingly and so on.

All defined labels are available in all repositories of the **osism** organization.

```yaml
labels:
    - name: needs rework
      description: "Needs rework"
      color: "b60205"
    - name: bug
      description: "Something isn't working"
      color: "d73a4a"
```
